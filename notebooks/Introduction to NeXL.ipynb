    "# Introduction to NeXL\n",
    "Nicholas W. M. Ritchie 30-Apr-2023 (nicholas.ritchie@nist.gov)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is NeXL?\n",
    "NeXL is a collection of packages (libraries) for the [Julia language](https://julialang.org) that implement common X-ray microanalysis algorithms, physical data and utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core NeXL packages are\n",
    "* [NeXLCore](https://github.com/usgovnist/NeXLCore) - Defines core concepts like elements, X-rays, atomic shells, k-ratios and fundamental electron and X-ray algorithms. \n",
    "* [NeXLMatrixCorrection](https://github.com/usgovnist/NeXLMatrixCorrection) - Implements algorithms for performing matrix correction for bulk samples\n",
    "* [NeXLSpectrum](https://github.com/usgovnist/NeXLSpectrum) - Implements data types and algorithms to handle spectra and hyper-spectra\n",
    "\n",
    "NeXL builds on many packages from the Julia infrastructure including\n",
    "* [Gadfly](https://github.com/GiovineItalia/Gadfly.org) - A \"grammar of graphics\" plotting package\n",
    "* [DataFrames](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) - \"Pandas-like\" tools for working with tabular data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Julia?\n",
    "Julia is a high-performance scripting language designed for numerical data analysis.  The base Julia libraries provide basic scalar, vector and matrix numerical analysis tools.  Julia differs from most scriptable languages in that all code is compiled before execution.  This leads to a \"slow then fast\" user experience.  The first time a method is used, it and all the methods it depends upon must be compiled.  This can lead to a significant delay.  However, once compiled, the code is fast - often as fast as C or Fortran code.  You will notice this \"slow then fast\" nature as you work with this notebook.  It is particularly evident when creating plots."
